\title{Latitudinal semi-corrected areas from pixels in degrees}
\usage{
deg2area(
  raster,
  classCriteria,
  outputUnits = "km2",
  intervalType = 2,
  corShape = "T",
  uncorrected = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{raster}{A raster object of class \code{RasterLayer}.}

\item{classCriteria}{Pixel values to be used as classification criteria for calculating the areas. It may be a single number or a vector for specific values, or a 2xN matrix with the lower and upper limits values when ranges.}

\item{outputUnits}{Measurement units of the output. It may be \code{"m2"} for square meters, \code{"km2"} for square kilometers, \code{"ha"} for hectare, \code{"yd2"} for square yards, \code{"mi2"} for square miles, and \code{"ac"} for acres. If no value is provided output is calculated in square kilometers by default.}

\item{intervalType}{Indicates the type of interval when \code{classCriteria} is a range matrix. It may be of four types: \code{1} for left open and right closed, \code{2} for left open and right closed except the first class which is closed, \code{3} for left closed and right open, and \code{4} for left closed and right open except the last class which is closed. By default it is \code{2}. The range matrix accepts \code{-Inf} and \code{Inf} as values.}

\item{corShape}{Indicates the geometric shape for the calculation of the areas. It may be "S" for square or "T" for a trapezoid (by default). When the shape is defined as a square, the pixel centroid latitude is used for the degrees to distance equivalence, and then the area is calculated for a perfect square in planar space. When the shape is a trapezoid, the area is calculated using the trapezium formula, in an attempt to approximate the real shape of the "cells" in a tridimensional space when increasing latitude. For this last, the total sum of areas for small resolution rasters is more precise (as in the Riemann sum) but computationally more expensive.}

\item{uncorrected}{Boolean indicating if the output should include a non-corrected area column (for comparison purposes only). The non-corrected area assumes distances at latitude 0Â°, that is, 1 arcsec = 30.87 meters. By default it is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame when the input is a single raster, or a list when multiple, including the pixel values used for classification, the number of pixels meeting the classification criteria, and the area in the selected units.
}
\description{
\code{deg2area} calculates semi-corrected areas from raster files with cells in degrees, given that the equivalence of degrees to distance varies cosine-based latitudinally. Areas are considered semi-corrected because despite the latitudinal correction, the procedure is performed in planar space.
