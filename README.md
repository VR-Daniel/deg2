# deg2

An R package for approximate latitudinal semi-corrected areas from raster files in degrees.

## Description

deg2 is an R package intended to calculate areas from pixels meeting certain criteria, considering the latitudinal variation in the relationship degree-distance. Areas are considered semi-corrected because despite the latitudinal correction, the procedure assumes pixels as perfect squares in planar space.

*Note: Currently, this is a BETA version and may contain errors. Use it at your own risk!*

## Getting started

### Dependencies
* RStudio with R (4.0.0 or higher)
* dplyr, raster

### Installing

* Download the devtools package, from the RStudio "Install Packages" menu or using:
```
> install.packages("devtools")
> library(devtools)
```
* Download and install the deg2 package using:
```
> install_github("VR-Daniel/deg2")
> library(deg2)
```

## Commands

* Calculate semi-corrected areas
```
> deg2area
```
* Calculate the equivalence between degrees and arcmin/arcsec, and vice versa
```
> deg2arc
```
