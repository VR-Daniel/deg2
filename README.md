# deg2

An R package for approximate latitudinal semi-corrected areas from raster files in degrees.

## Description

deg2 is an R package intended to calculate areas from pixels meeting certain criteria, considering the latitudinal variation in the relationship degree-distance. Areas are considered semi-corrected because despite the latitudinal correction, the procedure assumes pixels as perfect squares in planar space.

*Note: Currently, this is a BETA version and may contain errors. Use it at your own risk!*

## Getting started

### Dependencies
* RStudio with R (4.0.0 or higher)
* dplyr, raster

### Installing

* Download the devtools package, from the RStudio "Install Packages" menu or using:
```
> install.packages("devtools")
> library(devtools)
```
* Download and install the deg2 package using:
```
> install_github("VR-Daniel/deg2")
> library(deg2)
```

## Commands

* Calculate semi-corrected areas
```
> deg2area
```
* Calculate the equivalence between degrees and arcmin/arcsec, and vice versa
```
> deg2arc
```

## Version history
* 1.1.1
    * Fixed error message "Oops! Raster must have the same resolution in the x and y dimensions" when raster resolution differs by more than seven decimal places. By default, R displays a maximum of seven digits, so differences beyond that can make raster dimensions look the same. If the error appears, it is recommended to resample the raster to make the dimensions match
* 1.1.0
    * An option for calculating semi-corrected areas based on squared or trapezoidal "cells" was added (see deg2area function help)
* 1.0.0
    * Initial release
